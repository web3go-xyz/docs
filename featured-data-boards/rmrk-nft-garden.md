# RMRK NFT Garden

RMRK NFT Garden data board is where we showcase the analysis of NFT activities on RMRK platform, a place for users to acquire information about the market, minting, ownership, etc.

## How to use it?

2. There are four sections in the board, as you can see from the top navigation bar. The first one is the "Market Overview". It consists of "Volume over time on RMRK", "NFT Market Overview" and "Top 5 Collections". Note that you can filter the list of nft collection by entering the "start date" and "end date" at NFT Market Overview!

5. Now we switch to the fourth section - "Time Machine". It is a powerful tool which provides a history of the ownerships of the NFT assets, and allows the user to search by "Own NFT at date", "collection name", "nft name" or "owner address on kusama parachain".
