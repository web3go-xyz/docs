# Line chart

Line charts are good for plotting data captured in a sequence, whether that sequence is the passage of time, or steps in a process or flow. These charts are typically used to plot a time series (also known as a run chart), which includes a set of markers connected by lines, with the x-axis showing the passage of time and the y-axis plotting the value of a metric at each moment.
