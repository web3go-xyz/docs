Web3Go is an open data platform that focuses on the formatting, visualization, sharing, and collaborative analysis of the on-chain data generated in the Polkadot ecosystem.

##  Our vision

The interpretation and analysis of data should not be in the hands of certain centralized professionals, but rather all users should have a say and benefit from it. Our vision is to build a Polkadot-based data analytics infrastructure, toolset, and incentive system where everyone can publish and be rewarded for related data tasks. Finally, an open and free data platform will be built to surface the signals of what is happening in the Polkadot system.
